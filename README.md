To play the game install requirements.txt file and then run app.py
Type http://127.0.0.1:5000 into the browser
There are two game modes as of now: guess by picture and guess by description
A game has 10 rounds and to get a point one word from the title (japanase) must be correclty submitted
Random anime are polled from jikan api
Not entirely random as only certain animes are shown, like having more than 5000 members on MyAnimeList (a database website where users can add animes to their personal list)
Future features I plan to add:
-Difficulty settings
-Better string matching
